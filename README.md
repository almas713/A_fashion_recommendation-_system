# A_fashion_recommendation-_system
A fashion Recommendation system using deep learning Resnet50 and Nearest neighbour algorithm
In this project, we introduce a novel data-driven framework for fashion recommendation that emphasizes visual relevance and simplicity while ensuring effective product suggestions. Our approach follows a two-stage process: first, a CNN classifier extracts key features from an uploaded fashion imageâ€”allowing customers to submit any random fashion item from an e-commerce website. Then, based on the extracted features and texture, the system generates visually similar product recommendations. Advancing research in this area is crucial for enhancing recommendation accuracy and improving the overall fashion discovery experience for both direct and indirect consumers.
